Welcome to Jorien Chef's Kitchen!

I wanted to create a website about meals and recipes.

In this project I have used:
- Fetch API,
- Error Handling,
- LocalStorage,
- DOM manipulation,
- Bootstrap,
- Responsive Design,
- User interaction with input element. 

You can search ingredients which you have and can see what is the meal options include it.

Have Enjoy!
